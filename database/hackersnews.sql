We heard from a lot of people that the biggest thing holding them back from starting a company was that they didn&#x27;t want to do it alone and didn&#x27;t have any friends who wanted to do it with them.<p>So we built a site that&#x27;s similar to a dating site but for co-founders, and launched it on HN: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27750298\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27750298</a>.<p>Like any new product, we weren&#x27;t sure how well this would work.  Other people had tried this idea before, and none of them had really taken off.  But we thought YC had some unique advantages in doing it.<p>Fast forward to now, and frankly it&#x27;s worked better than we dared hope.  In the first two years, YC has invested in dozens of companies that came from people meeting each other on the site.  We wrote about three of the early successes here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;does-co-founder-matching-work\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;does-co-founder-matching-wo...</a>.  We believe that in the long term, this could be how hundreds or even thousands of successful startups get started.<p>Right now, only two engineers are working on this which is a bit crazy, so we&#x27;d like to hire someone else to help us move faster.  We use Rails and React, but you don&#x27;t have to have worked with Rails before as long as you have full stack web experience.<p>The majority of the team is in the SF Bay Area where the YC program runs.  You don&#x27;t have to be in SF but unfortunately we can only hire people in the US at the moment.<p>YC offers highly competitive compensation and benefits, including equity in YC&#x27;s portfolio.<p>The most unique benefit though, is that as part of the YC software team, you basically get full access to the YC program, founders, and partners - from our bi-annual batch retreats in Sonoma to our weekly meetups in SF.  You&#x27;ll learn the ins and outs of how YC works, and you&#x27;ll get to know hundreds of startup founders.  If you think you might want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping-off point.<p>If you’d like to work with us, there’s a formal job description here where you can apply (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;careers?ashby_jid=3d64f000-8d84-434c-87a0-62f4ccff9aae\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;careers?ashby_jid=3d64f000-8d84-...</a>) or just email me at jared@ycombinator.com.
